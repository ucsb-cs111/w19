The midterm exam will be in class {% include exam_on_from_to %}.

# Rules

You may use any books, notes, or written materials, but no electronic
devices of any kind.  (You won't need to do any complicated numerical
calculations.)

# Syllabus

The exam covers:

- all the assigned readings in NCM: sections 1.1 - 1.7, 2.1 - 2.7, and 10.1 - 10.3, but *not* 10.4 or 10.5.

- the material on conjugate gradient from my slides of January 20, *not* including anything after "Optional Analysis".

- the material on PageRank I covered in class February 1 and 3.

- Sections 1, 2, and 3 through 3.1 only, of the "$25 Billion" paper linked here.

- all the assigned homework problems


# Sample problems

- Here is a sample midterm from long ago (CS 111 was called CS 110A back then).

- Also, do Exercise 11 and Exercise 12 on page 8 of the $25 Billion paper.

The t.a.s will answer questions about the sample problems in section
on Friday, but you will have to work them yourself first in order to
be prepared for the exam!
