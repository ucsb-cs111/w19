The final exam will be in our regular classroom {% include exam_on_from_to %}.

# Rules

You may use any books, notes, or written materials, but no electronic
devices of any kind.  (You won't need to do any complicated numerical
calculations.)


# Syllabus

The final exam covers everything we've covered in the course,
including the material that was on the midterm.  That is,

- NCM sections 2.1-2.7, 7.1-7.10 10.1-10.5, 10.11, and 11.1-11.3.

- The material on conjugate gradient from my slides of January 20, *not* including anything after "Optional Analysis".

- The material on PageRank I covered in class February 1 and 3.

- Sections 1, 2, and 3 through 3.1 only, of the "$25 Billion" paper linked here.

- Frederic Gibou's module on solving diffusion equations.  (You should be able to formulate the steady-state and time-varying temperature problems in terms of the Laplacian matrix, using either my notation from class and from mydiffusion.m or else Prof. Gibou's notation from his notes.)

- List of topics:

* Matlab programming.
* Solving systems of linear equations.
* Permutation matrices and permutation vectors.
* LU factorization, pivoting.
* Jacobi iteration and conjugate gradients.
* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric matrices.
* The PageRank algorithm.
* Floating-point arithmetic.
* Standard form of ODEs.
* Lotka-Volterra equations.
* Forward Euler, backward Euler, and BS23 algorithms for ODEs.
* Finite difference algorithm for the diffusion equation in 1 and 2 dimensions.
* The discrete Laplacian matrix A2 and its properties.

# Sample problems

- The sample midterm problems still apply:

   - Here is a sample midterm from long ago (CS 111 was called CS 110A back then).

   - Also, do Exercise 11 and Exercise 12 on page 8 of the $25 Billion paper.

- Here is another sample final from a few years ago.


The t.a. will answer questions about the sample problems in section on
Friday, but you will have to work them yourself first in order to be
prepared for the exam!
