1. Let:

   $$
   A = \left(
   \begin{array}{ccc}
   3 & -1 & 2 \\ 	
   0 & 1 & 2 \\ 
   1 & 0 & -1 \\
   \end{array} \right).
   $$

   Do the following computations both by hand and with `numpy`.

   1. (3 pts) What is $$A^T$$?
   
      <div style="width: 4in; margin-left: 1in;  height: 6em; border: 1px solid black; "></div>
      
   2. (3 pts) What is $$A^2$$?
   
      <div style="margin-bottom:5em;"></div>
     
   3. (3 pts) What is $$A^TA$$?

      <div style="margin-bottom:5em;"></div>

2. (3 pts) The notation $$||x||_2$$ means the Euclidean norm (also
   called the 2-norm, or just the length) of the vector $$x$$.  What is
   $$||(3, 1, 4, 1, 5)^T||_2$$?

   <div class="pagebreak" />
   
3. Consider the following system of three equations in three unknowns:

   $$
   \begin{eqnarray}
    2x_1 - 3x_2 + x_3  & =  & 1 \\ 
    2x_2 + 3x_3  & =  & 7 \\ 
    x_1 + x_3  & = & 4 \\ 
   \end{eqnarray}
   $$ 
   
   1. (3 pts) First write this system in the form $$Ax=b$$, where $$A$$
      is a matrix and $$x$$ and $$b$$ are vectors.

      <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>
	 
   2. (3 pts) Second, write two lines of `numpy`
      code that use `np.array()` to create $$A$$ and $$b$$ as `numpy`
      arrays.

      <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>
   
4. What vector $$x$$ solves the system above? 

   <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>
   
5. Write down a 2-by-2 matrix $$A$$ and a 2-vector $$b$$ such that $$Ax=b$$
   has no solution.  Explain in a sentence why there are no solutions.

   <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>

6. Write down a 2-by-2 matrix $$A$$ and a 2-vector $$b$$ such that
   $$Ax=b$$ has more than one solution.  Give two different solutions.

   <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>
   
7. Is there a 2-by-2 matrix $$A$$ and a 2-vector $$b$$ such that $$Ax=b$$ has
   exactly two solutions?  Why or why not?

   <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>

8. Recall that a number $$\lambda$$ is an *eigenvalue*
   of a matrix $$A$$ if there is some vector $$x$$ 
   (an *eigenvector*) for which $$Ax = \lambda x$$.
   
   Give an eigenvalue of the following matrix, and a corresponding eigenvector.
   $$
   A = \left(
   \begin{array}{cc}
   4 & -1 \\ 	
   -1 & 4 \\
   \end{array} 
   \right).
   $$

   <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>

9. If $$f(x)=7x^3-2x^2+4x-5$$, what is $$f'(x)$$, the derivative of $$f(x)$$?

   <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>

10. If $$z = xe^{y/2}$$, what is $$\partial z / \partial x$$?
     What is $$\partial z / \partial y$$?

    <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>
   
11. If $$f'(x) = x^2 + \sin x$$, what is $$f(x)$$?

    <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>
   
12. The height in feet of a bullet fired straight up is
    given by $$h=1280t-16t^2$$, where $$t$$ is in seconds.
    What is the maximum height the bullet will reach? 
    When will it hit the ground?

    <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>

   
13. Suppose $$y$$ is a function of $$x$$ that satisfies
   $$dy/dx = xy$$, and also suppose $$y=1$$ when $$x=0$$.
   Write $$y$$ as a function of $$x$$.

   <div style="margin-bottom:4em;"></div>
