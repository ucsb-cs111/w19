Do NCM exercises 1.1, 1.5, 1.13, 1.15, 1.17.  Turn these in for a grade, in class,
or in the CS111 Homework box by {% include hwk_due_time_on_date %}.

<li> (3 pts)


Let
$$ A = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
3 & -1 & 2 \\ 	
0 & 1 & 2 \\ 
1 & 0 & -1 \\
\end{array} 
\right). $$
What is $$A^T$$?  What is $$A^2$$?  What is $$A^TA$$?
(Do these computations both by hand and with `numpy`.)
