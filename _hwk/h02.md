# To turn in

Do NCM exercises 2.1, 2.4, 2.8, and 2.10.  Turn these in for a grade, in class
or in the CS111 homework box by {% include hwk_due_time_on_date %}.

# Self-study

Do NCM exercises 2.3, 2.7, and 2.17.  Don't turn these in;
they are to test your own understanding.  Please feel free to discuss
the self-study problems with other students, on the course discussion
forum.
