# Homework Policy

There will be a homework assignment every week.  You may talk to each
other about the assignment, but what you submit must be your own work.
Most weeks there will be two sets of problems: one to be turned in for
a grade, and one for self-study to test your own understanding of the
course material.

All homework must be submitted in hard copy, on paper.  (Sorry, the
instructor is a dinosaur.)  We strongly encourage you to write up your
homework using LaTeX, which is the standard markup language used for
mathematical documents and papers.  To get you started, here is the
LaTeX for the review quiz.

When a homework exercise requires a Matlab program, turn in four things:

* A description in English of what you did and how.
* Your Matlab program listing (m-files; use "verbatim" mode in LaTeX).  Only turn in the code you wrote, don't include listings of all the NCM or other Matlab codes that your program uses.
* The relevant lines from the diary of your Matlab session running your program ("verbatim" in LaTeX).
* Copies of any output figures or plots (save figures as png or pdf and include in LaTeX).

Homework is due at the beginning of class (on Monday or Wednesday as
specified in the assignment), or in the CS 111 homework box in the
Computer Science mailroom, HFH 2108, by noon on the due date.  <span

circumstances,</span> but I will drop your two lowest homework grades.

If you have questions about grading of homework, talk to the
t.a. first.  If you are unable to reach an agreement, make an
appointment to talk to me.  <span style="color:red">The statute of
limitations for regrades is one week</span>&mdash;that is, any
requests for regrades must be made within one week after the homework
(or exam) was returned in section.
