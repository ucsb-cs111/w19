# Reading Assignment

[NCM](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/chapters/)
Sections 2.1 through 2.6 (linear equations and Gaussian elimination).


# Outline

Understanding Ax = b in the temperature problem.

Matrix and vector arithmetic in numpy.

(Maybe: Another Ax = b example: The fractal fern.)

Some interesting kinds of matrices: 
   - singular and nonsingular
   - triangular matrices
   - permutation matrices (and permutation vectors)
   - Gaussian elimination
   - LU factorization
   - Partial pivoting
