TODO: Edit and consider replacing with link to Piazza

There is a Google discussion group for the class at
<http://groups.google.com/group/ucsb-computer-science-111-fall-2010>. All
students are expected to join this group and to watch it for course
announcements. You may also use it to post questions for the
instructor and assistant (and answers to other people's
questions). The mailing address for posting to the group is
`ucsb-computer-science-111-fall-2010@googlegroups.com`.
