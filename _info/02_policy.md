# Homework policy

There will be a homework assignment every week. You may talk to each
other about the assignment, but what you submit must be your own work. 

All homework must be submitted in hard copy, on paper. 
We strongly encourage you to write up your homework using
LaTeX, which is the standard markup language for mathematical
documents. To get you started, [here is the LaTeX](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/old/cs111Fall2010/quiz/quiz.tex) for the [review quiz](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/old/cs111Fall2010/quiz/quiz.pdf).



1. the Matlab program listing (`.m` files; use `verbatim` mode in LaTeX)
2. the relevant lines from the diary of your Matlab session running the program
   (`\begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}` in
   [LaTeX](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/topics/latex/))
3. copies of any output figures or plots (save figures as pdf's and include in LaTeX)
4. a description in English of what you did and how

Homework is due on Fridays no later than 5:00 pm. 
You may turn in hardcopy homework to the CS111 homework box 
in the Computer Science mailroom; or you may bring it to class 
on the Wednesday before the Friday due date.
<span style="color:red">No late homework will be accepted
under any circumstances</span>, but I will drop your two lowest
homework grades.

If you have questions about grading of homework, you must talk to the 
grader or the t.a. first. If you are unable to reach an agreement, 
make an appointment to talk to me. <span style="color:red">The statute of
limitations for regrades is one week<span>&mdash;that is, any requests
for regrades must be made no later than one week after the homework
(or exam) was returned in class.
