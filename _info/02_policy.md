# Homework policy

There will be a homework assignment every week. You may talk to each
other about the assignment, but what you submit must be your own work. 

Homework is due on Fridays no later than 5:00 pm. 
You may turn in hardcopy homework to the CS 111 homework box 
in the Computer Science mailroom; or you may bring it to class 
on the Wednesday before the Friday due date; or you may submit
a PDF file no later than 5pm Friday.
<span style="color:red">No late homework will be accepted
under any circumstances</span>, but I will drop your two lowest
homework grades.

You may submit your homework either in hardcopy (on paper) or
as a PDF file.
I strongly encourage you to write up your homework using
LaTeX, which is the standard markup language for mathematical
documents. 
To get you started, [here is the LaTeX](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/old/cs111Fall2010/quiz/quiz.tex) for the [review quiz](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/old/cs111Fall2010/quiz/quiz.pdf).

When a homework problem requires writing some Python code, 
you should turn in all of the following. 

1. A description in English of what you did and how. Try to be brief
but clear. If we can't understand what you did, you will lose points;
we won't regrade homework that was not explained well.
2. The Python code you wrote.
3. The output from running your Python code.
(The easy way to do both (2) and (3) is to print your Jupyter notebook to pdf
and include it in your LaTex file.)
4. Any figures or plots you produced (save figures as pdf's and include in LaTex).

If you have questions about grading of homework, you must talk to the 
grader or the t.a. first. If you are unable to reach an agreement, 
make an appointment to talk to me. <span style="color:red">The statute of
limitations for regrades is one week<span>&mdash;that is, any requests
for regrades must be made no later than one week after the homework
(or exam) was returned in class.
