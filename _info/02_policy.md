# Homework policy

There will be a homework assignment every week. You may talk to each
other about the assignment, but what you submit must be your own
work. Most weeks there will be two sets of problems: one to be turned
in for a grade, and one for self-study to test your own understanding
of the course material.  All homework must be submitted in hard copy,
on paper. We strongly encourage you to write up your homework using
LaTeX, which is the standard markup language for mathematical
documents. To get you started, [here is the LaTeX](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/old/cs111Fall2010/quiz/quiz.tex) for the [review quiz](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~gilbert/cs111/old/cs111Fall2010/quiz/quiz.pdf).


When a homework exercise requires a Matlab program, turn in four things:

1. the Matlab program listing (`.m` files; use `verbatim` mode in LaTeX)
2. the relevant lines from the diary of your Matlab session running the program
   (`\begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}` in
   [LaTeX](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/topics/latex/))
3. copies of any output figures or plots (save figures as pdf's and include in LaTeX)
4. a description in English of what you did and how

Homework is due every Monday at the beginning of class, or in the
CS111 homework box in the Computer Science mailroom, 2108 HFH, by 9:00
am Monday. <span style="color:red">No late homework will be accepted
under any circumstances</span>, but I will drop your two lowest
homework grades.

If you have questions about grading of homework, talk to the grader or
the t.a. first. If you are unable to reach an agreement, make an
appointment to talk to me. <span style="color:red">The statute of
limitations for regrades is one week<span>&mdash;that is, any requests
for regrades must be made no later than one week after the homework
(or exam) was returned in class.
