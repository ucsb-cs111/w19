# Textbook:

One textbook we will use is: [Numerical Computing with Matlab](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/textbooks/ncm/), by Cleve Moler.   This textbook uses MATLAB rather than Python,
however, it is still an excellent reference for the topics we will study.

The book has a [web site](http://www.mathworks.com/moler/index_ncm.html).

Besides the bookstore, you can:
* download the book from its web site, or
* order it from [SIAM](http://ec-securehost.com/SIAM/ot87.html), the Society for
Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

You can get a discount on the book if you are a
[member of SIAM](http://www.siam.org/membership/individual/free.php),
which is free for UCSB students (talk to Prof. Gilbert.).
