# Software

Previous versions of this course used [MATLAB](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/topics/matlab/).

This quarter, we will be using Python in place of MATLAB.

* Python is available on CSIL.
* You can also download the latest version of
  Python 3.x for your machine here: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

When installing on Windows, be sure to select the option for adding Python to your
path, so that you'll have the option to run the `pip install` command at the
Windows command prompt.  You'll need `pip install` to be able to install packages
that we'll be using the course such as:

* [numpy](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/topics/numpy/)
* [scipy](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/topics/numpy/)
* [matplotlib](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/topics/matplotlib/)

There is also the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of Python
which may be helpful for our purposes.
