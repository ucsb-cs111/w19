# Software

We will be using Python for programming in this course, leaning heavily the following three packages:

* [numpy](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/topics/numpy/): Numerical computing with arrays and matrices
* [scipy](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/topics/scipy/): Some more advanced numerical computing, including sparse matrices
* [matplotlib](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/topics/matplotlib/): Plotting

We will use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to run Python interactively, in a web browser, both for demos 
in class and for your programming assignments. I strongly recommend that you set up your own laptop or computer to  
run Jupyter and Python 3 (and numpy, scipy, and matplotlib). 
The easy way to do this is to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), which
will install everything you need. The t.a.s will demo the setup process in the first sections, on Tuesday,
January 8.

It's also possible to run a Python in a Jupyter notebook in a web browser at CSIL. You can go that route if it
works better for you, but I think it's much easier to run everything on your own computer. (That's what I do.)

Previous versions of this course used [MATLAB](https://ucsb-cs111.github.io/topics/matlab/), which is a proprietary
interactive numerical software package (UCSB has a campuswide license). Numpy is designed to look a lot like Matlab,
in which arrays and matrices are the main data structures. If you already know Matlab, 
[here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html) is a cheat sheet for translating Matlab
into numpy; if you don't know Matlab, don't worry about it. The matplotlib library that we will use for plotting
also has a lot of similarity to Matlab's plotting routines.
